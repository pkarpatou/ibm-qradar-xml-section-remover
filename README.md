# IBM QRadar XML Section Remover

## Overview
The **IBM QRadar XML Section Remover** is a Python-based utility developed to support administrators and security engineers in preparing and maintaining XML configuration files within IBM QRadar environments.

It provides a graphical interface to identify and remove selected XML sections before reimporting or transferring configuration data. This reduces manual editing, promotes consistency between environments, and helps prevent errors during complex or large-scale operations.

## Functionality
- Opens XML configuration files  
- Detects top-level XML sections automatically  
- Enables checkbox-based selection of tags to remove (for example, `sensordevicecategory`, `sensordeviceprotocols`, `sensordevicetype`)  
- Supports removal of matching tags at any depth  
- Saves the modified XML while preserving structure and formatting  

## Usability Notes
- Tag detection uses local tag names to avoid namespace conflicts  
- Provides a summary of removed sections upon completion  
- Processes large XML files efficiently  

## Dependencies
Requires only the Python standard library:  
- `tkinter`  
- `xml.etree.ElementTree`  

## Execution
Run the application from the command line:

```bash
python ibm_qradar_xml_section_remover.py
```

## Context of Use
This utility was developed to streamline XML content maintenance and preparation when working with multiple QRadar instances, particularly in scenarios involving mass content migration or synchronization.  

While XML modification is not endorsed by IBM, such tasks are occasionally necessary. This tool assists by providing a controlled and auditable method for XML cleanup. It is intended for experienced QRadar administrators who understand their environment and validate all modifications before use in production.

Although the tool was inspired by the challenges of managing QRadar configuration files, it is designed to work with any XML file, making it useful for a wide range of XML cleanup and restructuring tasks.
